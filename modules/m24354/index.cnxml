      <title>Introduction </title>
      <para id="id8696222">The topics chosen for the modules in Grade 1 are all related to stories which reflect the learners’ experience in the world in which they are growing up. They are relevant to both boys and girls. </para>
      <para id="id1170070978213">Much depends on the number of times the learners hear the stories and rhymes and the provision made for the repetition of the vocabulary introduced. At first this is done classically. As the learners become more familiar with English they can communicate with a friend. Eventually they will want to tell the teacher and answer questions about the texts.</para>
      <para id="id6155394">The educators must keep in mind that there may be many/some learners in the class who are still only at the listening stage, but with the necessary encouragement and praise they will soon join in and begin speaking in English.</para>
      <section id="id2525170">
        <title>Time scheduled for the modules 1 to 8</title>
        <para id="id1170071203363">It is suggested that the average learners complete all eight modules during the year, finishing ± two modules per term.</para>
        <para id="id8275360">Allow the slower learners to proceed at their own pace when doing the written activities but expose them to all the listening and speaking activities with the class. </para>
        <para id="id1170070965971">The quick learners can be extended and given more tasks and activities to complete.</para>
        <para id="id1170071180150">“Funny little Kitty Cat” tells the story of Little Kitty finding her body parts – eyes, paws, ears, nose, mouth and with Mother Cat’s help determines what they are used for.</para>
        <para id="id1170073770125">The pictures are shown in sequence to enable learners to retell the story in sequence.</para>
        <para id="id1170070516791">With a variety of rhymes and activities basic vocabulary of the body, counting, colours and forms of greetings are learnt. Sentences with a frame, “I can . . . .” are repeated and initial verbs such as swim, hop, walk, run are introduced.</para>
        <para id="id1170068362841">Integration of themes</para>

          <item>Learners acquire an additional language – in this case – English, mainly through listening and later through repeating words and phrases. It is therefore important that much repetition will take place as well as constant revision of the vocabulary to which learners are being exposed. The story, Funny Little Kitty pages 1 and 2, should therefore be told over and over for the learners to become familiar with the words and phrases used.</item>
          <item>The story can be told while learners look at the picture on page. This picture can also be used to encourage them to talk and use the new language. They can also follow the story and join in with the educator.</item>
          <item>To make the dialogue interesting, the educator can make simple finger puppets or pictures on sticks for puppets. Learners, who want to speak English and have the confidence, can take turns to be the characters in the story. Miming and acting can also be used to encourage understanding etc.</item>
          <item>After much practice the learners can retell the story.</item>
          <item>Sing songs: Twinkle Twinkle; Heads and Shoulders.</item>
          <item>Say rhymes: See learning unit.</item>
          <item>Greet your learners in English regularly.</item>
